# Forkawesome survey

Here are the results of a survey I ran for about 4 months, from the 17th of December 2022 until the 5th of April 2023. It was advertised on [mastodon](https://mastodon.xyz/@forkawesome@floss.social/109524151669247963), [twitter](https://twitter.com/forkawesome/status/1604147911008587776) and as a [github issue](https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/issues/408). Thanks to the 28 respondents and to the [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/) crew for running their E2EE tools.

Here are the results, graphically depicted as best I could, with a short written summary after each:

Most respondents (22, 78%) had used Forkawesome. Most (18, 64%) were currently using Forkawesome.

Implementing icons through icon font was by far the most preferred method (19, 67%). All the SVG methods combined didn't even get half as many preferences (7, 25%). 

I'm curious what the other methods are people are using... presumably using raster images with `<img>` or similar? I wish I had given that option.

"Ease of font icon use" and "licensing" were perceived only positively. "style of icons", "ease of cross-platform use" and "number/coverage of icons" were perceived mostly positively. "Ease of SVG use" and "governance/management of project" had mixed perceptions. "Frequency of releases" was perceived mostly negatively.

Non-responses, "no opinion" and unanswered questions, were highest for "ease of SVG use" and "ease of cross-platform use". This corresponds with the previous question suggesting less SVG use. It also suggests

With the exception of Fontawesome, most responses were not responses. I take this to mean unfamiliarity with the other icons sets. Only "your favorite" and "ionicons" had overall positive responses, and even then still mixed. 

I find these results a bit difficult to interpret, but it at least suggests that for the respondents, there was no clearly superior icon set, given all their criteria for consideration.

The final question, in which respondents could select as many of the options as they wished. Most respondents (18, 64%) would like to see the project reactivate. Significant minorities (heck, everyone is a significant minority in a group of 28!) voted for the remaining options: to focus on SVG usage (8, 28%), to continue as before (7, 25%) and to encourage users elsewhere (4, 14%)

I've tried to keep my opinions out of the analysis as much as possible. An anonymized version of the raw results data is in this folder as a .csv and. 

I'm planning to write another post with my thoughts on this project soon: about licensing, about technical issues and relevance in 2023 onwards. For now it's safe to say that I'm open to other people getting involved, that I'm not planning to do significant technical work on Forkawesome any time soon.

Thanks for reading!
